    "review": "I read this book in only one day! It is really well-structured and easy to follow. It begins with some history to set the stage, and moves in an understandable way through the evolution of CSS layout. The pace is just the right speed, helping me to not feel stuck or confused at any point. The code examples and screenshots are very helpful. I particularly liked the last part of the book, which encourages those reading it to let their opinions be known, and make the change happen that they wish to see. It has encouraged me to keep more of an eye on standards formation going forward.",

    "review": "I grabbed this book out of curiosity after hearing it had won the Booker Prize amongst a lot of other good candidates. Before starting it, I had a good impression what it would be about - the story of the difficult childhood of a boy in Scotland. I found the characters to be quite raw and unforgiving. From what I can tell, the characters accurately portray the interactions and lives of people that exist in the real world. There are some uncomfortable and potentially triggering interactions, but this provides a very genuine story. I particularly enjoyed the emotional experiences and reactions of the mum and youngest son, Shuggie. I tried to put myself in their situation to think how I'd react. I like books that portray real people in real, difficult situations. I feel like it helps me learn things about myself, and become more empathetic and open-minded. I'd recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in complex, raw and real interactions in non-privelaged and struggling communities. The perspective it offers can only do good in the world.",

    "review": "This book was recommended by someone close to me who had read it quite a few years ago. It paints a picture of a very different and fantastical world. It is full of people who see their world as their 'normal'. I like how it deals with the relationships between the characters. Sometimes I found it a bit hard to predict what a character would do next, or what would happen in the story next. Perhaps that's a good thing though. I think this is a book you can lose yourself in and forget the real world a bit. The chapters are different lengths and some are almost poetic in nature. There is plenty of randomness thrown in. The end of the book seems to take a bit of a sudden turn and was a bit of a surprise. Overall, I am glad I read it, even if I didn't always entirely know what to make of the story.",

    "review": "This book was gifted to me at Christmas and I was really happy to have a German book that was already approved by a friend. I think this book helped me improve my German a lot. The way the book is written made it easy to read and understand what was going on. The characters felt real. The two main characters had both experienced trauma and the way they acted made me feel like the author really understood how trauma can affect people's behaviour and emotions. The characters are not polished or surface-deep. They don't always do smart things, but what they did made sense to me. My favourite things about the book are firstly that it is not predictable, and secondly that the characters tend to do the right thing, even if it is not the easiest thing. On top of this, the setting of the book, in the countryside, was really enjoyable for me. I found it funny that I learned lots of new 'farm' words in German. The book allowed me to imagine how life would be as a farmer, being closer to nature and away from the drama associated with being among people all the time!",

    "review": "This book starts like a poem, then time travels before diving beneath forests, and ends by dazzling with the ridiculously fascinating and tantalising world of fungi-human symbiotic possiblities. I read it with so much love and respect for how mother nature does her thing, and for the rare professionals and amateurs who seek to understand her ways. The vastness and mystery around the lives of fungi and its symbiotic partners actually reminds me of the vastness and mystery of space. There is endless space above us, and endless fungal activity below us. This books brings me hope that humans can manage their impact on the planet in a way that benefits both themselves and the ecosystem around them. The growing possibilities of working in partnership with the wonderful and boundless nature around us makes me feel happy.",
