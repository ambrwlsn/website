    "review": "This book was gifted to me at Christmas and I was really happy to have a German book that was already approved by a friend. I think this book helped me improve my German a lot. The way the book is written made it easy to read and understand what was going on. The characters felt real. The two main characters had both experienced trauma and the way they acted made me feel like the author really understood how trauma can affect people's behaviour and emotions. The characters are not polished or surface-deep. They don't always do smart things, but what they did made sense to me. My favourite things about the book are firstly that it is not predictable, and secondly that the characters tend to do the right thing, even if it is not the easiest thing. On top of this, the setting of the book, in the countryside, was really enjoyable for me. I found it funny that I learned lots of new 'farm' words in German. The book allowed me to imagine how life would be as a farmer, being closer to nature and away from the drama associated with being among people all the time!",

    "review": "This book starts like a poem, then time travels before diving beneath forests, and ends by dazzling with the ridiculously fascinating and tantalising world of fungi-human symbiotic possiblities. I read it with so much love and respect for how mother nature does her thing, and for the rare professionals and amateurs who seek to understand her ways. The vastness and mystery around the lives of fungi and its symbiotic partners actually reminds me of the vastness and mystery of space. There is endless space above us, and endless fungal activity below us. This books brings me hope that humans can manage their impact on the planet in a way that benefits both themselves and the ecosystem around them. The growing possibilities of working in partnership with the wonderful and boundless nature around us makes me feel happy.",
