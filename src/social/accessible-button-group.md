Dear accessibility friends, could you please advise me on what WAI-ARIA pattern most closely matches the following? Thank you:

A group of three buttons that act as information filters. Only one can be active at a time. They are not part of a form. Using JavaScript, they show or hide information based on the value of a data-attribute.
