## Like

- That the weather is getting warmer so we can all wear cute summery things.

- Using simple techniques to get better at completing 10-15 minutes of a project per day and seeing good results (book writing, piano, exercise).

- Daydreaming about learning languages — Spanish, French, sign language etc.

- Reconnecting a bit more with web folks.

- Learning more about finances and experimenting more with saving money.

## Dislike

- Things I pay for being late — public transport in Berlin, hairdresser, piano teacher (I understand companies and people have their reasons though of course).

- My short (1-meter) charging cable. I should have spent €10 extra for the 2-meter one.

- Not having enough time or brain power to read all my books.

- FOMO on Bluesky just because it gives me too much of a Twitter vibe and I don't want to be on it.

- Being ill a lot because I have a child old who goes to daycare.
