# Timeline
<br>

## October 2020

I opened Google Docs. Inside, I wrote down everything I could think of about switching careers to web development. I added a table of contents.

![Google Docs snippet showing October 2020](img/october-2020.png)

## April 2022

I bought and read "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00AB77M5S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o06">How to Write a Nonfiction eBook in 21 Days - That Readers LOVE!</a>" by Steve Scott. I opened my Google Doc and wrote down some useful pointers from the book.

## May 2022

I thought I better get on with my book, so I opened my Google Doc. I wrote an introduction and something about personal projects.

## June 2022

I used flashcards to organise a table of contents (which later changed almost completely).

![Chapters and subheadings organised onto flashcards](img/book-flashcards.jpg)


## September 2022

I bought and read "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0983HFQX7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00">Write Useful Books: A modern approach to designing and refining recommendable nonfiction</a>" by Rob Fitzpatrick. I opened my Google Doc and wrote down some useful pointers from the book. The book helped me realise the table of contents I had created needed improvement.

I bought and read two other career-switch-to-web books. These books helped me figure out what I did and didn't want in my book: "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Get-Job-Web-Development-ebook/dp/B07FBQXB5X/ref=sr_1_1">How to Get a Job in Web Development: The Ultimate Guide</a>" and "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B079152S5T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o05">How to Become a Web Developer: The Career Changer's Guide</a>".

## March 2023

Now that my child is in daycare, I can dedicate a little more time to writing. I can also keep telling myself that a little bit of writing a day is better than none. Logic over fear, let's go!

My writing mantra is to cut the fluff and tell people exactly what they need, in plain language. Currently feeling thankful for the longer, fluffier paragraphs I wrote years ago. I can take those and cut them down!

    <summary><strong>Update email 1 (31.03.23)</strong></summary>

<u>Progress</u>

I have begun to include a mix of personal stories and more factual information.

Even though I know I don't need to yet, I'm worrying about things like how to fit the personal stories around the facts, among other things like tone of voice.

I'm spending lots of time moving chunks of text around and deleting stuff.

I'm finding that I'm not very comfortable writing huge blocks of text without immediately editing them. Going back to the blocks the next day brings me fresh clarity that enables me to edit better!

<u>Sneak Peek</u>

None yet. Maybe next time ;)

<u>Inspiration</u>

I found a good post from [Leo Babauta](https://leobabauta.com/). He says to make writing easier, write for one person only. I'm writing for people who are in the position I was years ago. I'm writing for people who wish for a career change and are interested in becoming a web developer.

## April 2023

Chipping away at the book, paragraph by paragraph, night by night. The work feels slow. Like I am adding dominoes, one at a time, very, very gradually to a long and dusty, years-old line of old dominoes that stretches further than the eye can see. But, I feel good about it! I can't see or even <em>feel</em> the progress. Not really. But I know it is there. Once I wrote 100 words a day for 100 days and at the end had 10,000 words of material. Those few words I wrote every day felt so easy to write and grew into something huge. This is what's happening with my book as well.

I asked a good friend of mine if she'd share her experiences of becoming a developer with me. She said she'd be happy to support me <span role="img" aria-label="heart emoji">❤️</span>

I asked on Mastodon [whether anyone knows a new web developer who used to do something else](https://indieweb.social/@ambrwlsn/110208988232303128). I am excited to chat with people!

## August 2024

Hello! I'm back! I've been writing. I have a few chapters set up.

I'm currently grappling with a question.

If I write this book in public, include real developer stories, and ask for review help from other developers, how do I market the finished book?

I don't want to sell the book as if it's my accomplishment alone. I don't want to profit off of it alone. That feels greedy.

My current idea is to put it up as a digital file via an indie seller website for around $5. This feels underpriced but would make it more accessible to more people and hopefully nod to all the people who supported me along the way.

## April 2025

Alright. Nearly 5 years after starting the book, I am serious about finishing it this time. This may be due to my three year old now sleeping at a consistent time every evening.

I am planning to interview at least two more people for the section on people's personal experiences switching careers to web dev.

A pile of good notes exists that will slowly be worked through.

The task ahead feels daunting. I need some writing inspiration! On that note, a big shout out to my pal Laura for giving me some [much-needed motivation](https://mastodon.social/@alicetragedy/114397613412671541).
