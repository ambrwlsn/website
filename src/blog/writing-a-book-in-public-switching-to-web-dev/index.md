# Timeline
<br>

## October 2020

I opened Google Docs. Inside, I wrote down everything I could think of about switching careers to web development. I added a table of contents.

## April 2022

I bought and read "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00AB77M5S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o06">How to Write a Nonfiction eBook in 21 Days - That Readers LOVE!</a>" by Steve Scott. I opened my Google Doc and wrote down some useful pointers from the book.

## May 2022 

I thought I better get on with my book, so I opened my Google Doc. I wrote an introduction and something about personal projects.

## June 2022

I used flashcards to organise a table of contents (which later changed almost completely).

## September 2022

I bought and read "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0983HFQX7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00">Write Useful Books: A modern approach to designing and refining recommendable nonfiction</a>" by Rob Fitzpatrick. I opened my Google Doc and wrote down some useful pointers from the book. The book helped me realise the table of contents I had created needed improvement.

I bought and read two other career-switch-to-web books. These books helped me figure out what I did and didn't want in my book: "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Get-Job-Web-Development-ebook/dp/B07FBQXB5X/ref=sr_1_1">How to Get a Job in Web Development: The Ultimate Guide</a>" and "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B079152S5T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o05">How to Become a Web Developer: The Career Changer's Guide</a>".

## March 2023

Now that my child is in daycare, I can dedicate a little more time to writing. I can also keep telling myself that a little bit of writing a day is better than none. Logic over fear, let's go!
