I coached a new codebar student on HTML tonight. As she and I made our websites on owls, many tips for new developers popped into my head - in the order you see below!

Let me know your thoughts ‚ù§

*  **Developer tools** - <q>Developers use this every single day...it's awesome and super helpful, and smart devs know how to utilise it!</q>
*   **Text editor** - <q>Every dev has their fave one...they have tonnes of downloadable extras to help you create the perfect development playground!</q>
*   **Github** - <q>version control, collaboration with other devs, and code sharing... so many great projects and people!</q>
*   **Open source** - <q>Shared projects, diverse inputs, inspirational outputs... the spirit that makes the Web great!</q>
*   **Stack Overflow** - <q>A developer's encyclopedia... a good dev will spend time every day searching online for the best answers!</q>
*   **Readable code** - <q>Writing code and commenting for other devs in your team to read... hugely important for a happy developer environment!</q>
*   **HTML = structure, CSS = style** - <q>Very important to keep in mind... see CSS Zen Garden for the best depiction of this!</q>
*   **Devs aren't perfect** - <q>Even the super-super smart ones... everyone has gaps in their knowledge, and there are definitely things you can teach them too!</q>
*   **Networking** - <q>meetups, workshops, pair-programming, clubs, events... doesn't matter where, but it matters that you do it (good things happen)!</q>
*   **Learning** - <q>This is key to enjoying development work... learn, create, share, repeat!</q>
