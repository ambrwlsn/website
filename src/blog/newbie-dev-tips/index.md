I coached a new codebar student on HTML tonight. As she and I made our websites on owls, many tips for new developers popped into my head - in the order you see below!

Let me know your thoughts ‚ù§

*   Developer tools - <q><small>Developers use this every single day...it's awesome and super helpful, and smart devs know how to utilise it!</small></q>
*   Text editor - <q><small>Every dev has their fave one...they have tonnes of downloadable extras to help you create the perfect development playground!</small></q>
*   Github - <q><small>version control, collaboration with other devs, and code sharing... so many great projects and people!</small></q>
*   Open source - <q><small>Shared projects, diverse inputs, inspirational outputs... the spirit that makes the Web great!</small></q>
*   Stack Overflow - <q><small>A developer's encyclopedia... a good dev will spend time every day searching online for the best answers!</small></q>
*   Readable code - <q><small>Writing code and commenting for other devs in your team to read... hugely important for a happy developer environment!</small></q>
*   HTML = structure, CSS = style - <q><small>Very important to keep in mind... see CSS Zen Garden for the best depiction of this!</small></q>
*   Devs aren't perfect - <q><small>Even the super-super smart ones... everyone has gaps in their knowledge, and there are definitely things you can teach them too!</small></q>
*   Networking - <q><small>meetups, workshops, pair-programming, clubs, events... doesn't matter where, but it matters that you do it (good things happen)!</small></q>
*   Learning - <q><small>This is key to enjoying development work... learn, create, share, repeat!</small></q>
