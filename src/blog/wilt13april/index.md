At [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com) today, I ran through many new (and some familiar) things with [Jeremy](https://adactio.com):

*   We talked about [Jeremy](https://adactio.com)'s upcoming event - [Patterns Day](http://patternsday.com/) (check out the site, it's nifty - also, buy a ticket!), to be held on June 30th. Jeremy kindly invited me along and I'm really excited!
*   I found out where [Clearleft](clearleft.com) got their idea for the 100 day challenge - [Aaron Parecki](https://twitter.com/aaronpk)'s [100 days of music](https://100.aaronparecki.com/)!
*   I learned that these _amazing_ [color fonts](http://www.colorfonts.wtf/) won't be available for a while (sadly).
*   I discovered a nice example of excellent forward-thinking. The creators of the [font-weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) CSS property use 100-700 for weighting type, not 1-7\. This is because they anticipated that more values could be utilised in the future. Now they can, with [variable fonts](http://typographica.org/on-typography/variable-fonts/).
*   Microformats [rel values](http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values) (a question about these sprung up when I coached at [codebar](https://codebar.io) earlier in the week).
*   HTML5 [link types](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.12).
*   XFN - The [HTML5 Friends Network](http://microformats.org/wiki/XFN). Jeremy has nice examples on his own site including rel="friend" and rel="met" in his 'bedroll' section.
*   Examining what rel="canonical" does (it helps Google reference original publications).
*   Twitter [card validators](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).
*   I completed [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/). It was really fun and I like the specs a lot.
*   Jeremy has written things about [CSS Grid](https://adactio.com/links/tags/grid). We dove into discussions about [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), and also [Flexbox](https://flexbox.io/). I learned how Grid and Flexbox were created by the same people and share a lot of vocabulary. This means they can both be utilised in the same stylesheet to suit different purposes.
*   I downloaded Firefox, as it has some nice developer tools for visualising a grid on the page.
*   I learned a little about product management in a 'brown bag' talk at [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com). Very interesting learning about exercises to coordinate teams and define roles (including those of clients) within a project and help everyone communicate better.
*   Talked with Jeremy about my upcoming [Material](https://web.material.is/2017/) conference talk. We brainstormed lots of great ideas that I wrote down. My next step is mindmapping to find some golden connections between ideas.
*   Chatted with Jeremy and Luke about roles that involve both front end development and UX. An area that draws heavily on both roles is performance, particularly percieved performance.
*   Jeremy recommended some books on writing - including Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style', particularly the chapter on 'The Curse of Knowledge', and 'Bird by Bird' by Anne Lamott.
*   I learned of the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) where e-books are lent out free of charge.
*   Talked with Jeremy and [Hannah](https://clearleft.com/team/hana-stevenson) about [cookies](/blog/cookies/), caching, and public speaking.
*   I was introduced to a number of very useful [thought exercises](https://adactio.com/journal/9732) I can have a go at once I have some content for my talk.
*   I discovered Google's [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) tool for evaluating websites.
*   Jeremy set me homework - ['What is the Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS?'](https://twitter.com/ambrwlsn90/status/852557145853833218)
*   Jeremy suggested talks that could help me with mine from [Render Conference 2017](http://2017.render-conf.com/) - Ana Balica's talk on [HTTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtTKF5OcpsU) and Frances Ng's [rise from Aerospace Engineer to Front-End Engineer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df0-2e6M_y4)
*   Jeremy introduced me to @supports in CSS, plus a neat way to [load fonts](https://fontfaceobserver.com/) using JavaScript that improves perceived performance by customising font loading behaviour.
*   Jeremy showed me the difference between not using the font-loading method vs. using it. There was a really large difference in perceived performance (font loading was better, despite the page loading slightly slower).
*   Jeremy showed me 4 design boards (each from a different designer) that helped him design his event site for [Patterns Day](http://patternsday.com/).
*   I saw some 'page painting' in chrome developer tools showing after a discussion on 'janky' sites. Jeremy told me he had to remove an image from his event site after he found it to be create this unwanted phenomenon.
*   I was introduced to [CSS shapes](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/) and the browsers that currently [support them](https://caniuse.com/#search=css%20shapes).

An intense but fantastic day - I'd like to thank Jeremy once again for his time and great advice :)
