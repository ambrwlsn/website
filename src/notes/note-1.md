My first note, inspired by [Elisabeth Hirgen's notes](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/).

This long weekend I had three tech things on my mind - watching all videos for [week 2 of CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/2/), tweaking an accessibility blog post that I began over a month ago, and learning more about web components.

The non-tech things I had on my mind were re-buying some pachira aquatica (money tree) plants as two of my old ones are currently in plant heaven, watching movies, and practicing piano.
