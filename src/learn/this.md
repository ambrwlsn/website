The `this` keyword is found in various programming languages, and behaves a certain way in JavaScript. Apparently even experienced developers get confused by it.

See this [codepen](https://codepen.io/ambrwlsn90/pen/ELEmxw?editors=1111) for some example code. It showcases one of the six ways `this` is used in JavaScript - thanks to what I learned from Zell Liew's great [blog post](https://zellwk.com/blog/this/). I really recommend this post for beginners - you can try the examples in your console! In short, `this` can be used globally, in object constructions, object methods, simple functions, arrow functions, and event listeners. See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) for more code-heavy examples.
