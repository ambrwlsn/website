    <p>My name is Amber and I'm a front end engineer. I currently work at N26 where I use a wide range of modern web technologies including React, GraphQL, Jest, Apollo, and webpack.</p>

    <p>I am particularly interested in web performance, accessibility, and security. This is because I strongly believe the web is for everyone, regardless of disability or device. I also believe in using the least powerful technology possible for any task.</p>

    <p>In 2016 I began attending <a href="https://codebar.io">codebar</a> in Brighton (UK) to gain developer skills. Once I began my internship in 2017 I switched to help organise codebar in Brighton, and from 2018 onwards in Berlin. I have given several talks at conferences across Europe, and volunteered at/attended many others.</p>

    <p>I'm constantly learning, every day, as a developer. I'm thankful for the wonderful dev community I'm a part of, and for every learning experience. It makes me feel so good to look back at my progress. I can't wait to see how much I'll learn in the coming years.</p>
