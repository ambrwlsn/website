            These are the books I've read or listened to in the last four
            years. Skip to a year using the dropdown menu! Each block contains a
            review, a picture, the book's length, format I read/heard it in
            (audiobook, kindle, physical book), and summary of characteristics.

            The images on this page total 600kb but to stop them being
            downloaded all at once I added native lazy loading so they will only
            load as you scroll! So, there is only ~200kb of images on page load
            vs 600kb (<a class="link-single" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=loading-lazy-attr">check browser support here</a>).
